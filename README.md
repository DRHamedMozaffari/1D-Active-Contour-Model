# 1D-Active-Contour-Model-
1D Active Contour Model for Raman Baseline Correction

The two files are python codes for Raman spectrum baseline correction. The current code is only the algorithm and implemented technique. We will add more explanation and our databases as well as methods for generating synthetic data after publishing our work.
